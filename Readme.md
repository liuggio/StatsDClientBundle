StatsD Client Bundle
===================

This bundle is not stable for sf2.2 help the community or just wait.

If you are using Symfony 2.1 go to the [2.1 branch](https://github.com/liuggio/StatsDClientBundle/tree/2.1)

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/liuggio/StatsDClientBundle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/liuggio/StatsDClientBundle)

This bundle helps you to monitor your application.

It uses [statsd-php-client](https://github.com/liuggio/statsd-php-client) as **Client** for the etsy/Statsd API.

It Includes

* a **Service**, a **Factory** and an Entity callable by the DIC
* a **Monolog Handler**
* a series of **Collectors** in order to aggregate your personal data.

## Abstract

Monitoring what is happening in your production Symfony2 application, with StatsD and Graphite.

Within this bundle you could use ready-to-go monitor for

- Monolog (this is very powerful feature)

- Amount of visitor

- Logged vs Anonymous user

- SQL: Verbs used (amount of select/set/update/upgrade/delete) (this feature is not suggested, please use a server monitor tool eg. nagios, munin)

- Amount of PHP ram used

- You could create your own using the Factory and the Service.

### Easy Debug

If debug mode is enabled no packet are sent over the udp socket, and you could see what's going on reading the syslog with `tail -f /var/log/syslog`

```log
Mar 19 00:48:11 liuggio nginx: statsd-open
Mar 19 00:48:11 liuggio nginx: statsd-write "tvision.visitor:1|tvision.memory:43520|tvision.user.anonymous:1|tvision.query.start:1|tvision.query.insert:1|c" 118 Bytes
Mar 19 00:48:11 liuggio nginx: statsd-close
```
Note: by default in `dev` environment debug is true.

One UDP packet to rule them all
-------------------------------

With a proper config file, your StatsD server will receive in a single upd packet:

```txt
prefix.visitor:1|c                  # Increment visitor
prefix.user.anonymous:1|c           # The visitor is not logged

prefix.log.app.error.user_action:1  # Stats by monolog with $this->get('logger')->error('user_action')

prefix.memory:4480|g                # The php memory peak was 4480 MB

prefix.exception.exception.500:1|c  # Exception occurred, the Exception code was 500

prefix.query.insert:1|c             # Query Insert
prefix.query.select:1|c             # Query Select
```
